The class CustomScanner contains:
    -> SymbolTable
    -> List of tokens from tokens.in
    -> A regex for identifiers
    -> A regex for constants
    -> An inorder traversal for identifiers
    -> An inorder traversal for constants

Functions:
    -> loadTokens()
        -> reads the file tokens.in and adds every single token inside the class List.
    -> scan()
        -> reads the provided file with the code of a problem and analyzes the format of it. If there is any character
        or group of characters that do not match the requirements of the language there will be an error.
        -> otherwise, every constant/identifier that is found will be saved in the SymbolTable
    -> createPIF()
        -> reads the provided file with the code of a problem and categorizes every character/group of characters found.
        -> it creates a file called PIF.txt where we will have information about the position of every element from the
        file inside the SymbolTable
