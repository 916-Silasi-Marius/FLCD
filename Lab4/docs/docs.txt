The DFA first reads the input from FA.in file where we can find:
    - list of states
    - the alphabet
    - initial state
    - list of final states
    - list of state rules

    The application has a menu that provides you the possibility to view all the elements above. The menu also contains
an option where you can provide a set of characters that will soon be evaluated, deciding rather the sequence is correct
or not.
